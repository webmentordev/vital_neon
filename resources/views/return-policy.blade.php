            <h3>Vital Neon: Returns Policy</h3>
            <p>At Vital Neon, customer satisfaction is our priority. We accept returns and offer refunds exclusively for faulty products. Our commitment is to address and resolve any issues promptly. Depending on the nature of the fault, we may choose to fix, replace, refund, or provide a partial refund. The final decision rests on a case-by-case assessment and is at the discretion of Vital Neon.</p>

            <h3>Vital Neon Warranty</h3>
            <p>Our indoor and outdoor products come with a one-year warranty covering electrical components under appropriate usage. Please note that indoor signs are not suitable for outdoor use or exposure to moisture, as such use will void the warranty. Resolving faults is contingent on the source and will be determined collaboratively between Vital Neon and the purchaser.</p>

            <h3>Warranty Coverage for Installed Signs</h3>
            <p>Vital Neon holds no responsibility for costs related to the installation or uninstallation of your sign. In the rare event of a presumed fault, we may request photos and videos for diagnostic purposes and may ask for the sign to be returned for replacement or repair. If you've chosen professional installation, any costs associated with uninstallation and reinstallation are not covered under our One-year warranty.</p>

            <h3>Vital Neon Returns Procedure</h3>
            <p>To initiate a return, contact us at <span class="text-main font-semibold">contact@vitalneon.com</span>, providing details of the products and the reason for return. Attach a short video and photos showcasing the issue, as both are essential for diagnostic and quality purposes. If agreed upon, return the faulty product in its original condition with all packaging within 14 days of receipt.</p>
            <p>If a replacement is approved, we'll work to produce and ship the replacement promptly. If a refund is agreed upon, we'll communicate the expected timeline for the refund.</p>

            <h3>Damaged in Transit</h3>
            <p>We recommend inspecting your Vital Neon parcel upon delivery. In the rare event of transit damage, report it within 14 days of delivery with clear photos of the damaged sign, outer box, and shipping label to your LED Neon Designer or {}. This ensures a swift resolution.</p>

            <h3>Lost, Missing & Stolen Signs</h3>
            <p>Vital Neon takes utmost care in delivery. We use a premium express shipping service that requires a signature on delivery. If you choose to opt-out of the signature requirement, Vital Neon assumes no responsibility for lost, missing, or stolen parcels marked as 'delivered' by the shipping service.</p>
